TODO: Add feature_matching evaluation, where we pick two random images that
        overlap, perform the matching, calculate the score, and repeat.
        Should help us get a handle on the error in feature matching under
        best-case circumstances vs the error due to propagation of that error.
TODO: Should this file be titled "README"?
